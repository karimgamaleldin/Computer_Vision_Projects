# Computer Vision Projects

Welcome to the TensorFlow Computer Vision Projects repository! This collection of projects is designed to showcase the practical application of deep learning techniques in the realm of computer vision. Each project is implemented using TensorFlow, a leading open-source framework for machine learning.

## About the Repository

In this repository, you'll find a series of hands-on projects that address various computer vision challenges. From image classification and object detection to facial expression recognition and more, these projects are aimed at demonstrating the capabilities of deep neural networks for visual recognition tasks.

The primary goals of this repository are to:

- Showcase practical implementations of computer vision tasks using TensorFlow.
- Highlight my ability to design, train, and fine-tune deep neural networks for visual recognition.
- Provide a resource for others interested in learning about computer vision and TensorFlow.

## Projects

1. [MNIST](1.MNIST_Dataset/): A multiclass classification model to distinguish between hand writen digits (1 -> 9).
2. [FoodVision101](2.FoodVision101/): A multiclass classification model to distinguish between 101 classes of food.
3. [CIFAR10](3.CIFAR10/): A multiclass classification model to distinguish between 10 classes like dogs , airplanes and much more.
5. [Cats vs Dogs](4.CatsVsDogs/): A multiclass classification model to distinguish between 10 classes like dogs , airplanes and much more.


Each project folder contains the source code, dataset information (if applicable), and a README with project-specific details.
