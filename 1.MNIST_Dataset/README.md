# Deep Learning Project: MNIST Digit Classification using Google Colab

Welcome to the Deep Learning MNIST Digit Classification project, hosted on Google Colab! This project focuses on using TensorFlow to build and train a deep neural network for recognizing hand-written digits from the famous MNIST dataset, all within a Google Colab notebook.

## About the Project

In this Google Colab-based project, we tackle the task of digit classification using a deep learning approach. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. Our goal is to design a deep neural network that can accurately predict the digit represented in each image.

The primary objectives of this project are:

- Build and train a deep neural network model using TensorFlow in a Google Colab notebook.
- Utilize Google Colab's resources for accelerated model training and experimentation.
- Experiment with different neural network architectures, hyperparameters, and training techniques to optimize model accuracy.

## Project Contents

The Colab notebook in this project includes:

- Step-by-step code for loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset.
- Implementation of a deep neural network model for digit classification.
- Training and evaluation of the model using TensorFlow.
- Visualizations and analysis of model performance.

## Results and Discussion

After experimenting with various neural network architectures and training settings, we achieved a classification accuracy of 96% on the MNIST test dataset.
